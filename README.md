Reflection

 1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I make sure my code is functional by writing and running unit tests, which help identify and fix bugs early. Automated tests like JUnit let me cover a wide range of scenarios, making the code reliable. For security, I focus on best practices: validating inputs, securing sensitive data, and avoiding hard-coded information.


 2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I put myself in the user’s place to understand what they want and need from the program. By visualizing how they’ll use the app, I can design features that make sense and are easy to use. It’s about making the app practical, efficient, and tailored to their goals.


3. How do I approach designing software?
I start by mapping out the main features and their connections, like a blueprint of the app. I focus on functionality first, ensuring that the core features work well. Then I add user-friendly elements to make the experience smoother. This approach balances logic and usability for a well-rounded design.
